    <h1>THE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY THINGS</h1>

    <main>
        <p>If I were placed in the cockpit of a modern jet airliner, my inability to 
            perform well would neither surprise nor bother me. But why should I have 
            trouble with doors and light switches, water faucets and stoves? “Doors?”
             I can hear the reader saying. “You have trouble opening doors?” Yes. 
             I push doors that are meant to be pulled, pull doors that should be pushed, 
             and walk into doors that neither pull nor push, but slide. Moreover, 
             I see others having the same troubles—unnecessary troubles. 
             My problems with doors have become so well known that confusing doors are often 
             called “Norman doors.” Imagine becoming famous for doors that don’t work right. 
             I’m pretty sure that’s not what my parents planned for me. (Put “Norman doors” 
             into your favorite search engine—be sure to include the quote marks: it makes 
             for fascinating reading.)
            How can such a simple thing as a door be so confusing? A door would seem to be 
            about as simple a device as possible. There is not much you can do to a door: 
            you can open it or shut it. Suppose you are in an office building, walking 
            down a corridor. You come to a door. How does it open? Should you push or pull, 
            on the left or the right? Maybe the door slides. If so, in which direction?
             I have seen doors that slide to the left, to the right, and even up into 
             the ceiling.
