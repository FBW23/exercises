    <section><h1> THE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY OF EVERYDAY <br> THINGS</h1>

    <p> I were placed in the cockpit of a modern jet airliner, my inability to perform well would neither surprise nor
      bother me. But why should I have trouble with doors and light switches, water faucets and stoves? <b>“Doors?”</b>
      <br>I can hear the reader saying. <b>“You have trouble opening doors?” </b>Yes. I push doors that are meant to be
      pulled, pull doors that should be pushed, and walk into doors that neither pull nor push, but slide. Moreover, I
      see others having the same troubles—<i>unnecessary troubles.</i> My problems with doors have become so well known
      that confusing doors are often called <b>“Norman doors.”</b> Imagine becoming famous for doors that don’t work
      right. I’m pretty sure that’s not what my parents planned for me. (Put<b>“Norman doors”</b> into your favorite
      search engine—be sure to include the quote marks: it makes for fascinating reading.)
      How can such a simple thing as a door be so confusing? A door would seem to be about as simple a device as
      possible. There is not much you can do to a door: you can open it or shut it. Suppose you are in an office
      building, walking down a corridor. You come to a door. How does it open? Should you push or pull, on the left or
      the right? Maybe the door slides. If so, in which direction? I have seen doors that slide to the left, to the
      right, and even up into the ceiling.
          </p>
  
        
    <br>        
    <p>The design of the door should indicate how to work it without any need for signs, certainly without any need for
      trial and error.
      A friend told me of the time he got trapped in the doorway of a post office in a European city. The entrance was
      an imposing row of six glass swinging doors, followed immediately by a second, identical row. That’s a standard
      design: it helps reduce the airflow and thus maintain the indoor temperature of the building. There was no visible
      hardware: obviously the doors could swing in either direction: all a person had to do was push the side of the
      door and enter.
      My friend pushed on one of the outer doors. It swung inward, and he entered the building. Then, before he could
      get to the next row of doors, he was distracted and turned around for an instant. He didn’t realize it at the
      time, but he had moved slightly to the right. So when he came to the next door and pushed it, nothing happened.
      <b>“Hmm,”</b>he thought,<b>“must be locked.”</b> So he pushed the side of the adjacent door. Nothing. Puzzled, my
      friend decided to go outside again. He turned around and pushed against the side of a door. Nothing. He pushed the
      adjacent door. Nothing. The door he had just entered no longer worked. He turned around once more and tried the
      inside doors again. Nothing. Concern, then mild panic. He was trapped! Just then, a group of people on the other
      side of the entranceway <i>(to my friend’s right)</i> passed easily through both sets of doors. My friend hurried
      over to follow their path.</p><section class="numbers">1</section></section>

   <section><p>How could such a thing happen? A swinging door has two sides. One contains the supporting pillar and the hinge,
      the other is un- supported. To open the door, you must push or pull on the unsupported edge. If you push on the
      hinge side, nothing happens. In my friend’s case, he was in a building where the designer aimed for beauty, not
      utility. No distracting lines, no visible pillars, no vis- ible hinges. So how can the ordinary user know which
      side to push on? While distracted, my friend had moved toward the (invisible) supporting pillar, so he was pushing
      the doors on the hinged side. No wonder nothing happened. Attractive doors. Stylish. Probably won a design prize.
    </p>
    <p>Two of the most important characteristics of good design are <u>discoverability</u> and understanding.
      Discoverability: Is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to per- form them?
      Understanding: What does it all mean? How is the product supposed to be used? What do all the different controls
      and settings mean?</p>
    <p>The doors in the story illustrate what happens when discoverability fails. Whether the device is a door or a
      stove, a mobile phone or a nuclear power plant, the relevant components must be visible, and they must communicate
      the correct message: What actions are possible? Where and how should they be done? With doors that push, the
      designer must provide signals that naturally indicate where to push. These need not destroy the aesthetics. Put a
      vertical plate on the side to be pushed. Or make the supporting pillars visible. The vertical plate and supporting
      pillars are natural signals, naturally interpreted, making it easy to know just what to do: no labels needed.</p>
    <p>With complex devices, discoverability and understanding require the aid of manuals or personal instruction. We
      accept this if the device is indeed complex, but it should be unnecessary for simple things. Many products defy
      understanding simply because they have too many functions and controls. I don’t think that sim- ple home
      appliances—stoves, washing machines, audio and television sets—should look like Hollywood’s idea of a spaceship
      control room. They already do, much to our consternation.
    </p>
    <p>Faced a bewildering array of controls and displays, we simply memorize one or two fixed settings to approximate
      what is desired. <br>
      In England I visited a home with a fancy new Italian washer- dryer combination, with super-duper multisymbol
      controls, all to do everything anyone could imagine doing with the washing and drying of clothes. The husband (an
      engineering psychologist) said he refused to go near it. The wife (a physician) said she had simply memorized one
      setting and tried to ignore the rest. I asked to see the manual: it was just as confusing as the device. The whole
      pur- pose of the design is lost.

      <h2> The Complexity of Modern Devices</h2>

      <p>All artificial things are designed. Whether it is the layout of furniture in a room, the paths through a garden
        or forest, or the intricacies of an electronic device, some person or group of people had to decide upon the
        layout, operation, and mechanisms. Not all designed things involve physical structures. Services, lectures,
        rules and procedures, and the organizational structures of businesses and governments do not have physical
        mechanisms, but their rules of operation have to be designed, sometimes informally, sometimes precisely recorded
        and specified.
        <p>But even though people have designed things since prehistoric times, the field of design is relatively new,
          divided into many areas of specialty. Because everything is designed, the number of areas is enormous, ranging
          from clothes and furniture to complex control rooms and bridges. This book covers everyday things, focusing on
          the interplay between technology and people to ensure that the products actually fulfill human needs while
          being understand- able and usable. In the best of cases, the products should also be delightful and enjoyable,
          which means that not only must the requirements of engineering, manufacturing, and ergonomics be satisfied,
          but attention must be paid to the entire experience, which means the aesthetics of form and the quality of
          interaction. The major areas of design relevant to this book are industrial design, interaction design, and
          experience design. None of the fields is well defined, but the focus of the efforts does vary, with industrial
          designers emphasizing form and material, interactive designers emphasizing understandability and usability,
          and experience de- signers emphasizing the emotional impact. Thus:</p>
        <p>Industrial design: The professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that
          optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and
          manufacturer (from the Industrial Design Society of America’s website).

          Interaction design: The focus is upon how people interact with technology. The goal is to enhance people’s
          understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occurred. Interaction de- sign draws
          upon principles of psychology, design, art, and emotion to ensure a positive, enjoyable experience.

          Experience design: The practice of designing products, processes, ser- vices, events, and environments with a
          focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience.

          Design is concerned with how things work, how they are con- trolled, and the nature of the interaction between
          people and technology. When done well, the results are brilliant, pleasurable products. When done badly, the
          products are unusable, leading to great frustration and irritation. Or they might be usable, but force us to
          behave the way the product wishes rather than as we wish.
          Machines, after all, are conceived, designed, and constructed by people. By human standards, machines are
          pretty limited. They do not maintain the same kind of rich history of experiences that people have in common
          with one another, experiences that enable us to interact with others because of this shared understanding.
          Instead, machines usually follow rather simple, rigid rules of be- havior. If we get the rules wrong even
          slightly, the machine does what it is told, no matter how insensible and illogical. People are imaginative and
          creative, filled with common sense; that is, a lot of valuable knowledge built up over years of experience.
          not very good at. Machines have no

        leeway or common sense. Moreover, many of the rules followed by a machine are known only by the machine and its
        designers.
        When people fail to follow these bizarre, secret rules, and the machine does the wrong thing, its operators are
        blamed for not understanding the machine, for not following its rigid specifications. With everyday objects, the
        result is frustration. With complex devices and commercial and industrial processes, the resulting difficulties
        can lead to accidents, injuries, and even deaths. It is time to reverse the situation: to cast the blame upon
        the machines and their design. It is the machine and its design that are at fault. It is the duty of machines
        and those who design them to understand people. It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless
        dictates of machines.
        The reasons for the deficiencies in human-machine interaction are numerous. Some come from the limitations of
        today’s technology. Some come from self-imposed restrictions by the designers, often to hold down cost. But most
        of the problems come from a complete lack of understanding of the design principles necessary for effective
        human-machine interaction. Why this deficiency? Because much of the design is done by engineers who are experts
        in technology but limited in their understanding of people.<b>“We are people ourselves,”</b>they think,<b>“so we
          understand people.”</b>But in fact, we humans are amazingly complex. Those who have not studied human behavior
        often think it is pretty simple. Engineers, moreover, make the mistake of thinking that logical explanation is
        sufficient: <b>“If only people would read the instructions,”</b>they say,<b>“everything would be all right.”</b>
        Engineers are trained to think logically. As a result, they come to believe that all people must think this way,
        and they design their machines accordingly. When people have trouble, the engineers are upset, but often for the
        wrong reason. “What are these people doing?” they will wonder. “Why are they doing that?” The prob- lem with the
        designs of most engineers is that they are too logical. We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the
        way we would wish it to be.</p>
            
      <p>I used to be an engineer, focused upon technical requirements, quite ignorant of people. Even after I switched
        into psychology and cognitive science, I still maintained my engineering emphasis upon logic and mechanism. It
        took a long time for me to realize that my understanding of human behavior was relevant to my in- terest in the
        design of technology. As I watched people struggle with technology, it became clear that the difficulties were
        caused by the technology, not the people.
        I was called upon to help analyze the American nuclear power plant accident at Three Mile Island (<i>the island
          name comes from the fact that it is located on a river, three miles south of Middle- town in the state of
          Pennsylvania</i>). In this incident, a rather simple mechanical failure was misdiagnosed. This led to several
        days of difficulties and confusion, total destruction of the reactor, and a very close call to a severe
        radiation release, all of which brought the American nuclear power industry to a complete halt. The operators
        were blamed for these failures:<b>“human error”</b>was the immediate analysis. But the committee I was on
        discovered that the plant’s control rooms were so poorly designed that error was inevitable: design was at
        fault, not the operators. The moral was simple: we were designing things for people, so we needed to understand
        both technology and people. But that’s a difficult step for many engineers: machines are so logical, so orderly.
        If we didn’t have people, everything would work so much better. Yup, that’s how I used to think.
