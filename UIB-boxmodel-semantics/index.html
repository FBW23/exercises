            <h3>Brief band History</h3>
            <p>Isis (sometimes stylized ISIS) was an American heavy metal band founded in Boston, Massachusetts in 1997
                and
                later based in Los Angeles. The band borrowed from and helped to evolve the post-metal sound pioneered
                by
                bands such as Neurosis and Godflesh, characterized by lengthy songs focusing on repetition and evolution
                of
                structure. Isis's last studio album, Wavering Radiant, was released on May 5, 2009. Isis disbanded in
                June
                2010, just before the release of a split EP with the Melvins. In 2018, the group reformed as 'Celestial'
                for
                a one-off show to pay tribute to Caleb Scofield.</p>

            <h2>Themes</h2>
            <p>Most of Isis' releases revolve around a theme. While each release has its own unique theme, many of
                the major releases interconnect. Turner has stated: "we wanted to have albums that weren't just
                grab-bags of songs but rather a cohesive experience from beginning to end, from the music to the lyrics
                to the layout of the record."
                <br>
                No Isis album contains an explicit diegesis, or story arc, instead focusing on themes rather than
                stories. As such, releases are defined by some as "pseudo-concept albums". The band see lyrics as
                important, but at the same time, Turner does not feel it necessary to enunciate every word.
                Instead, any connections made are mainly conjecture, and the formation of a theme takes into account the
                album artwork, previous albums, track titles and the use of metaphor just as much as lyricism. Oceanic
                tells a convoluted tale involving love, incest and suicide by drowning. This relates to the theme of
                the all-powerful female, present lyrically in every album except Panopticon. Turner does not explicitly
                acknowledge an "overtly feminine theme"; however, he does state: "I just think it's interesting to
                include that as part of what we do, simply because metal, especially, is considered to be this very
                male-oriented, testosterone-driven art form, and I feel like it's important to recognize the other side
                of our nature. As manly as we might or might not be, we have to acknowledge that there is a feminine
                part of our persona, and that the world isn't made up of absolutes. To achieve balance, you have to
                recognize every facet of yourself and everyone else around you." Certain threads do reappear between
                albums, notes Turner. "There are certain themes which reoccur in my work just because of what I'm
                interested in and what is aesthetically pleasing for me," he says. "The idea of futuristic utopias and
                dystopias is probably something that does consciously and subconsciously return time and time again
                [...] and sometimes I just can't help the fact that these themes creep into my work whether it's
                conscious or not." The other two ongoing motifs in the lyrics and artwork are that of towers and
                mosquitos.
                <br>
                Panopticon was an overtly political release, and arguably the clearest statement made within their music
                yet. It displayed fears of surveillance and of tacit governmental influence; its namesake, the
                panopticon, was Jeremy Bentham's concept for a prison system in which all the prisoners can be viewed by
                one guard in a central tower, without being able to know whether they are being observed or not. Bentham
                described the Panopticon as "a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind, in a quantity hitherto
                without example." Quizzed on government conspiracies, Turner states: "I do believe that each and
                every day our government and the huge corporate entities of this country lie to us about numerous
                subjects. In this respect we are all victims of a huge conspiracy—most of those in power are only
                concerned with the advancement of their agendas and have no qualms about deceiving and hurting the
                American people."
                <br>
                After constantly explaining concepts and story outlines to interviewers and fans, Turner chose to keep
                the thematic basis of In the Absence of Truth quiet. "Through explaining the last two albums time and
                time again, I just started to become weary of the topic, and I started to feel like I was losing my
                connection to the music and the lyrics simply from having repeated it so many times [...] I feel there's
                a lot of emphasis these days placed on explaining everything in such a fashion that there's really
                nothing left for the listener or reader to explore themselves. It's all spelled out," Turner continues.
                "So it's interesting to leave some of that stuff open-ended so they have to do a little bit of legwork
                themselves."] He was similarly reticent about revealing much which went into Wavering Radiant, beyond
                noting that Carl Jung's theories, and dreams, served as inspiration.</p>
            <h2>Conceptual Elements</h2>
            <p>Turner has gone on record saying "I like the idea of preserving at least a little shred of mystery and
                making the band to be more an entity—without hopefully sounding too pretentious – as a work of art [than
                a traditional rock band]". Turner has also said in an interview in New Zealand music magazine Rip It
                Up that "we don't want to hand-feed everything to the listener. We just want to have a sense of
                mystery". There is a definite attitude that art and music are interchangeable and synonymous to the
                band; he feels that "the songwriting and the artwork come from the same place". This logic relates
                to visual and aural aspects as well as overt intellectualisation, through literary references and
                driving philosophies. Books such as Don Quixote, House of Leaves, Labyrinths and the philosophies
                of Jeremy Bentham have all played a role in shaping the themes of Isis' releases.
                <br>
                There is an overt intention of progressing heavy music present in Isis' output; a desire to further the
                intellectual cause that pushes them forward. This is evident within the clear progression of their
                sound from release to release, their influence on heavy music, and their acceptance in art circles where
                other metal bands are not so readily embraced. Their stated goal is "not to break away from the scene
                that [they] came from, but to expand upon it". Publications such as Terrorizer attest to how Turner
                has completed his goal, explaining that "Aaron Turner has loosened hardcore from its geographical roots,
                and in the process created an intimate, yet immeasurable vision all of his own". Turner has
                complained that "metal in general has long been unjustly maligned as solely the province of
                knuckle-dragging meatheads [...] That said, there's never been a group of musicians like there is now,
                who are helping to advance the form."
