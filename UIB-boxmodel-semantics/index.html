                <h4>Who are Those fuckers</h4>
                <p> Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created by Justin Roiland and
                    Dan
                    Harmon for Cartoon Network's late-night programming block Adult Swim. The series follows the
                    misadventures of cynical mad scientist Rick Sanchez and his good-hearted but fretful grandson Morty

        <h1>What is Snorkeling?</h1>
        <p>Snorkeling (British and Commonwealth English spelling: snorkelling) is the practice of swimming on or through a body of water while equipped with a diving mask, a shaped breathing tube called a snorkel, and usually swimfins. In cooler waters, a wetsuit may also be worn. Use of this equipment allows the snorkeler to observe underwater attractions for extended periods with relatively little effort and to breathe while face-down at the surface.</p>

            <h1>Equipment</h1>
            <p>Essential equipment includes the snorkel for breathing, and a diving mask or swimming goggles for vision. Swimfins for more efficient propulsion are common. Environmental protection against cold, sunburn and marine stings and scratches is also regionally popular, and may be in the form of a wetsuit, diving skins, or rash vest. Some snorkellers rely on waterproof sunscreen lotions, but some of these are environmentally damaging. If necessary the snorkeller may wear a weightbelt to facilitate freediving, or an inflatable snorkelling vest, a form of buoyancy aid, for safety.</p>

      <h1>Practice of snorkeling</h1>
      <p>Snorkeling is an activity in its own right, as well as an adjunct to other activities, such as breath-hold diving, spearfishing and scuba diving,[18] and several competitive underwater sports, such as underwater hockey and finswimming. In all cases, the use of a snorkel facilitates breathing while swimming at the surface and observing what is going on under the water.

            Being non-competitive, snorkeling is considered more a leisure activity than a sport.[19] Snorkeling requires no special training, only the very basic swimming abilities and being able to breathe through the snorkel.[20] Some organizations, such as BSAC,[by whom?] recommend that for snorkeling safety one should not snorkel alone,[21] but rather with a "buddy", a guide or a tour group.</p>
