                            <h3>Magical Messi stars as Barca thrash Valladolid to go top</h3>
                            Lionel Messi inspired Barcelona to a 5-1 win over Real Valladolid, scoring twice and assisting two more as the defending champions went top of La Liga.
                            It took the Catalans just three minutes to open the scoring when Clement Lenglet lashed home a left-footed strike from 10 yards out after Real Valladolid failed to clear a Messi freekick into the area. However, the visitors struck back when Kiko Olivas bundled home after a cross had bounced off Marc-Andre Ter Stegen.
                            Barca regained control just before the half hour mark, though, with Messi clipping a pass over the top for Arturo Vidal to divert home. And the 32-year-old provided the highlight of the night moments later, finding the top corner of the net with a trademark freekick.

        <h1>What is Snorkeling?</h1>
        <p>Snorkeling (British and Commonwealth English spelling: snorkelling) is the practice of swimming on or through a body of water while equipped with a diving mask, a shaped breathing tube called a snorkel, and usually swimfins. In cooler waters, a wetsuit may also be worn. Use of this equipment allows the snorkeler to observe underwater attractions for extended periods with relatively little effort and to breathe while face-down at the surface.</p>

            <h1>Equipment</h1>
            <p>Essential equipment includes the snorkel for breathing, and a diving mask or swimming goggles for vision. Swimfins for more efficient propulsion are common. Environmental protection against cold, sunburn and marine stings and scratches is also regionally popular, and may be in the form of a wetsuit, diving skins, or rash vest. Some snorkellers rely on waterproof sunscreen lotions, but some of these are environmentally damaging. If necessary the snorkeller may wear a weightbelt to facilitate freediving, or an inflatable snorkelling vest, a form of buoyancy aid, for safety.</p>

      <h1>Practice of snorkeling</h1>
      <p>Snorkeling is an activity in its own right, as well as an adjunct to other activities, such as breath-hold diving, spearfishing and scuba diving,[18] and several competitive underwater sports, such as underwater hockey and finswimming. In all cases, the use of a snorkel facilitates breathing while swimming at the surface and observing what is going on under the water.

            Being non-competitive, snorkeling is considered more a leisure activity than a sport.[19] Snorkeling requires no special training, only the very basic swimming abilities and being able to breathe through the snorkel.[20] Some organizations, such as BSAC,[by whom?] recommend that for snorkeling safety one should not snorkel alone,[21] but rather with a "buddy", a guide or a tour group.</p>
