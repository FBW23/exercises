                            <h3>Magical Messi stars as Barca thrash Valladolid to go top</h3>
                            Lionel Messi inspired Barcelona to a 5-1 win over Real Valladolid, scoring twice and assisting two more as the defending champions went top of La Liga.
                            It took the Catalans just three minutes to open the scoring when Clement Lenglet lashed home a left-footed strike from 10 yards out after Real Valladolid failed to clear a Messi freekick into the area. However, the visitors struck back when Kiko Olivas bundled home after a cross had bounced off Marc-Andre Ter Stegen.
                            Barca regained control just before the half hour mark, though, with Messi clipping a pass over the top for Arturo Vidal to divert home. And the 32-year-old provided the highlight of the night moments later, finding the top corner of the net with a trademark freekick.
