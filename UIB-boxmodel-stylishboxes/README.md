# Boxes, boxes and more boxes

**Instructions**:
* Task 1: Add `:before` and `:after` pseudo elements to the section with the `fake-box` class. Create an effect which makes it seem like the content is in a 3D box.

* Task 2: Align the sections with the class `info-box` side-by-side. Give the elements a box shadow.
