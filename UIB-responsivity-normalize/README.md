* What do you notice now that `normalize.css` is being used? Add your answer to this `README` file.

the website became slightly different compare to others especially the border link. It is more precision.

* Why is `normalize.css` useful? 

This means that you don't have to redeclare styles for all the common typographic elements. When an element has different default styles in different browsers, normalize.css aims to make those styles consistent and in line with modern standards when possible

* What is the difference between normalize and css resets? 

Normalize.css preserves useful defaults rather than "unstyling" everything. For example, elements like sup or sub "just work" after including normalize.css (and are actually made more robust) whereas they are visually indistinguishable from normal text after including reset.css. So, normalize.css does not impose a visual starting point (homogeny) upon you. This may not be to everyone's taste. The best thing to do is experiment with both and see which gels with your preferences.
