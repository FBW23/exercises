// Bonus: Create a function average which accepts any amount of numbers and returns their mean average.

// The mean average of a set of numbers is calculated by adding them all up and dividing the result of the addition by the amount of numbers in the set
// Example: To calculate the average of 12, 14 and 16 -
// 12 + 14 + 16 = 42
// 42 / 3 = 14

const average = () => {};

console.log(average(0)); // -> 0
console.log(average(1, 2)); // -> 1.5
console.log(average(1, 3, 6, 10)); // -> 5
console.log(average(12, 14, 16)); // -> 14
