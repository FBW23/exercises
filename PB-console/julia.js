//1. Console log a line of text eg. "this is an exercise in console logging" (do not forget quotation marks). 

let firstString = 'this';

let secondString = 'is';

let thirdString = 'an';

let fourthString = 'exercice';

let fifthString = 'in';

let sixthString = 'console';

let seventhString = 'logging';

let eighthString = '"';

let myString = eighthString + ' ' + firstString + ' ' + secondString + ' ' +  thirdString + ' ' + fourthString + ' ' + fifthString + ' ' + sixthString + ' ' +  seventhString + ' ' + eighthString;


console.log(myString);




//2. Declare a variable and give your variable the following value: "This is the value.". Console log your **variable**. 

let value = "This is the Value"; 
console.log(value);


//3. Declare a variable called firstName and assign your first name to that variable. Do the same with your last name. Console log both variables. NOTE: When console logging two variables, separate the variables with a comma (,) in the console log e.g. console.log(variable1, variable2);

let firstName = 'Julia';
let lastName = 'reis';

console.log(firstName , lastName);


//4. Make a profile of someone's information. Store all the information in variables eg. name, city, job etc. (five variables total) Console log the variables. 

let name = 'Claudia';
let city = 'Berlin';
let job = 'Project Manager';
let hair = 'Brown';
let favoriteFood = 'Confort';

console.log(name, city, job, hair, favoriteFood);




//5. Print a sentence using the profile variables above, adding text where necessary for sentence flow, i.e., "John Smith is a 43 year old teacher who lives in Berlin". **you can combine variables with text in the console by using the plus symbol (+) e.g. console.log("this is a " + variable);** 
let where = 'lives in';
let work = 'work as a';
let appearence = 'her hair is';
let food = 'and her favorite food is';



console.log(name, where, city, work, job, appearence, hair, food, favoriteFood);

favoriteFood= 'favorite food'
console.log(favoriteFood);

console.log(name, where, city, work, job, appearence, hair, food, favoriteFood);
favoriteFood= 'confort food'
console.log(favoriteFood);

console.log(name, where, city, work, job, appearence, hair, food, favoriteFood);
