# Programming Basics: Arithmetic Operators

These exercises are aimed at making you familiar with the arithmetic operators. **Print your results to the console at the end of each step**.

0. Declare two variables "x" and "y" and assign them number values. 

1. Add x and y. 

2. Subtract y from x. Then, subtract x from y. 

3. Multiply x and y. 

4. Divide x by y. 

5. Declare another variable "z" with value "10". Multiply x and y. Then, divide the result by z. Store the result in a new variable named "resultOne". Print "resultOne" to the console.

5. Declare two variables: "a" with value 15, and "b" with value 9. Divide a by b. 

6. Declare another variable "c" with value 20. Add a and b, then multiply the result by c. Store the result in variable "resultTwo".  Print "resultTwo" to the console.

7. Increment a.

8. Decrement b.

9. Subtract a from b and store this in a new variable "d". Add d and c.

10. Print the remainder when "resultOne" is divided by "resultTwo" to the console.
