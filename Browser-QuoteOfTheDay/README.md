# Quote of the Day

Create random quote app, that shows a random quote when ever the user loads the App(page) or clicks the get random quote button.

```javascript
const quotes = [
    "Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.",
    "Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.",
    "The secret of getting ahead is getting started.",
    "Well done is better than well said.",
    "You miss 100% of the shots you donâ€™t take.",
    "A goal is a dream with a deadline.",
    "Outstanding people have one thing in common: An absolute sense of mission.",
    "Trying is winning in the moment.",
    "Fall down seven times and stand up eight.",
    "You just can't beat the person who never gives up.",
    "There is little success where there is little laughter.",
    "We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them."
  ];
```


1.  Create a function that returns a random quote from the array of
    quotes that's given. Remember that there's a nice function for
    random numbers in the MDN documentation for `Math.rand()`.

**Note:** _Sometimes it's a good idea to create multiple functions, that
do one specific thing only, to make the code more readable and
easier to maintain / extend._

2.  Add a Random Quote button beneath the quote element. When the button is clicked, a new quote should be generated.

3.  **Optional:** Style to your pleasing & feel free to load/use bootstrap via CDN.

> Hint: Refer to the representation below, for an idea of what your result should look like.
