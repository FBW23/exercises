# Programming Basics: Logical Operators

These exercises are aimed at making you familiar with logical operators. **Print all your checks to the console. Every capitalized word stands for the logical operator that you must use in each task. Make sure that you are using the *correct* logical operator.**

0. Declare two variables: "a" with the value of true, and "b" with the value of false. 

1. Check the result of:

- a) a AND b. 

- b) a OR b. 

- c) NOT (a AND b). 

2. Declare three more variables "x", "y", "z". Give these variables number values. 

3. Check the result of whether:

- a) x is greater than z AND x is greater than y. 

- b) x is NOT equal to y. 

- c) z is less than y OR z is greater than x. 

- d) x is equal to z OR x is NOT equal to y.

- e) x is greater than or equal to 10 AND y is less than or equal to 10. 

- f) x multiplied by z is less than 100 OR whether x multiplied by y is greater than 100. 

4. BONUS: Explain in words the logic of each result in a comment after the result.
